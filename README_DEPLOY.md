# Deployment Guide for Lekhan Portfolio

This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. To deploy it with your own custom URL, follow these steps:

## 1. Choose a Hosting Platform

### Option A: Railway (Recommended for Full-Stack)
Railway is excellent for apps with a persistent backend and database.
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/).
2. Connect your GitHub repository `lekhan-portfolio`.
3. Railway will automatically detect the `package.json` and run the build/start scripts.
4. **Environment Variables**: Add `DATABASE_URL` (you can provision a MySQL database directly on Railway).
5. **Custom Domain**: Go to the "Settings" tab of your project, find "Domains", and add your own URL.

### Option B: Vercel (Optimized)
I have optimized the repository for Vercel using Serverless Functions.
1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
2. Import your `lekhan-portfolio` repository.
3. **Framework Preset**: Select `Vite`.
4. **Build Command**: `pnpm build`
5. **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
6. **Environment Variables**: Add `DATABASE_URL`.
7. **Custom Domain**: Go to "Settings" -> "Domains" to add your own URL.

## 2. Database Setup
This project uses **Drizzle ORM** with **MySQL**.
- If using Railway, you can add a MySQL service to your project.
- If using Vercel, you can use **TiDB Cloud** (Serverless MySQL) or **PlanetScale**.
- Once you have the connection string, add it as `DATABASE_URL` in your hosting platform's environment variables.

## 3. Custom Domain (Your Own URL)
To use your own URL (e.g., `www.lekhan.me`):
1. Purchase a domain from a registrar (like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains).
2. In your hosting platform (Railway/Vercel), add the domain.
3. Update your domain's **DNS settings** (A record or CNAME) as instructed by the hosting platform.

## 4. Final Steps
- Run `pnpm db:push` (or `npm run db:push`) to set up your database schema.
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly.
